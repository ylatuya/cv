\section{Master thesis}
\cvline{title}{\emph{LongoMatch: a sports video analysis tool based on Free Software}}
\cvline{supervisors}{Massimo Mecella}
\cvline{description}{\small LongoMatch is a multi-platform Open Source software for performance
 analysis through video. It's written in C\# with Mono, using GStreamer for the multimedia
 backend and GTK+ for the UI}

\section{Bio/Skills}
\cvline{Learning to code}{I learned to code on my own reading the manual of a TI-82 graphing
 calculator at the age of 16, where I wrote my first program: a Hangman game. Then I started
 my studies as a telecommunications engineer learning the basics of software engineering
 using Java.}
\cvline{Starting a big project}{At some point I felt the need of starting a new project to
 improve my coding skills, learn a new language and discover the challenges of starting a
 big project from scratch. So I started LongoMatch, a Free Software project for sports
 performance analysis through video. LongoMatch has kept me entertained on my free time,
 discovering all the phases of the software development: design, development, releasing and
 packaging and maintaining an online community.}
\cvline{The Free Software community}{With LongoMatch I started being involved in the Free Software
 community, specially in the GStreamer project. I started GStreamer WinBuilds, a project parallel
 to GStreamer to provide pre-compiled binaries of GStreamer on Windows and LongoMatch was one of
 the first projects to use GStreamer on this OS.}
